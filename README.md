# That's Enormous!

That's Enormous was a game show that Tom ran at his house for a few years. After the first
"episode", I decided he needed proper software instead of a hacked up Excel spreadsheet, so I wrote
some.

It's all pretty "installation art" quality, but I put it up here for historical amusements.
